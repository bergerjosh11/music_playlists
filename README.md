Code Challenge for Housecall Pro

To run from cmd line: simply enter 'ruby playlist.rb'

Unfortunately, I only had 45 minutes that I could dedicate to this, so this is just a quick script that I spun up. If I had more time, I would've made a fully functioning rails app instead of doing a quick 1-page ruby script.
A fully functioning rails app, complete with Active Record, would allow me to use a database that would be able to better manage this data rather than using memory, 
as well as utilyzing a RESTful API to retrieve and update the json files. If there was a large volume of traffic, I could harness batching via the controllers while utilyzing REST.
